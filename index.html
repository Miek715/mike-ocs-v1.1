<h5 style="font-size: 20px"> Monica backstory</h5>
<h6> Monica was born in a family known for their extrodinary levels of knowledge and smartness, but Monica was not as smart. Due to that, her parents crossed multiple red lines just to keep the family name going, but that did not help as it only made things worse. Eventually, her parents gave up and kicked her out of the house at the age of 14.</h6>
<h7 style="font-size: 20px"> What happened next? (tw: rape)</h7>
<h8> Monica has been on the streets for around 6 months after being kicked out. One day, she found a alley to rest in and hide, not expecting the events happening next. After a while, she saw someone walking in the alley. He had blue hair and a white shirt. His name is Amor. Monica was scared and tried to run away from Amor, but she was not fast enough, as Amor grabbed her before she could have a chance. Amor proceeded to prepare to rape the little girl. Monica tried attacking Amor, but all she got back was a scar on the eye. Amor quickly grabbed her and started raping her. At the time, Mike only spent 30 minutes being homeless, eventually he encountered Amor raping Monica while searching for a place to live. Mike quickly grabbed a stick and stabbed Amor in this testicles. Amor then collapsed on the ground and died. Monica thanked Mike and developed feelings for Mike as time went on. Then the two spent their last youthful years enjoying eachother's company and robbing McDonalds'. </h8>
